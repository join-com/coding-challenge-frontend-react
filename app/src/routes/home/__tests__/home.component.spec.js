          'Two issues here, but related enough that they are combined in this single request.  Both are related to the flow of pedestrians and bicycles where the bicycle path crosses the sidewalk on the Northeast side of Mass Ave near Cameron.  \n\nFirst, there is a dangerous visibility issue created by the control panel of the BlueBikes kiosk.  Pedestrians and bicycles and scooters (especially children) which approach the kiosk either along the sidewalk (along the NE side of mass ave and traveling in the direction coming from arlington) or along the bike path toward the Mass Ave crossing (ie passing in front of all the blue bikes) can not see each other.  My 4 yo and I have been involved in several near misses.  My request is to eliminate the visibility issue somehow, perhaps by moving the BlueBikes control panel to the other end, or to make it substantially shorter in height or...(?)\n\nSecond, is a need for signage in that same location in regards to right of way or the lack of right of way rules or something.  I realize that we are talking about an intersection on the sidewalk of the traffic flow of non-motorized vehicles which is perhaps off the usual jurisdiction of the traffic department(?).  The issue is that folks traveling along the sidewalk (including adults and kids on bikes and scooters) and folks on bicycles crossing the street at speed with the bike green light have a crossing on the sidewalk that is perhaps unexpected and catches many people off guard.  My son and I have witnessed and have been part of numerous nears misses.  My request is to put up some signage either declaring some right of ways rules on the sidewalk there, or at least warning people of the hazard.\n',
